# Heumann_rates_and_controls_Nfix_2023
Data and analysis code for "rates and controls of nitrogen fixation in post-fire lodgepole pine forests" 

 Cryptic N fixation project from 2022-2023
This folder contains four data folders as well as the R_project file used for the analysis of the seasonal cryptic N fixation field data from Heumann et al. 2023. 
The climate experiment data in contained in the cryptic_clim_exp_2022 folder

To access the entire seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2022 repository onto your computer
1. clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/robbieheumann/Seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2022.git

2. change the working directory to this cloned repository
   cd Seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2022

3.For seasonal cryptic N fix data and analysis open the R project named Seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2022
[**For cryptic N fix climate experiment analysis skip to step 7)

5. open and run FINAL_flux_scaling_01_25_2023 in DATA_AND_ANALYSIS_rates_and_controls_of_CNF_in_post_fire_PICO_forests_Heumann_2023\seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2\1_Protocol
6. for final flux modeling and analysis code open seasonal_flux_models_2_7_2023 in the same folder as above

7. for cryptic N fix climate experiment data and analysis open Climate_experiment_analysis in DATA_AND_ANALYSIS_rates_and_controls_of_CNF_in_post_fire_PICO_forests_Heumann_2023\cryptic_clim_exp_2022\2_protocol
8. run the above script then open and run clim_exp_analysis_update.03.10.2023 in the same folder as above
9. for final analysis figures an dmodeling open and run clim_exp_analysis_figures_03_16_23 in the same folder as above.

10. RAW data is available in the 0-data folders in both seasonal_cryptic_fixation_2022 and cryptic_clim_exp_2022 folders in excel spreadsheets with RAW endings in their file names.
